# Sound Detect
Detect a sound based in the training data

Tests the trained model on the held-out test set and calculates the accuracy of the model.

Please note that this is just an example, and real-world datasets can be more complex and would require more processing before training a model. Also, the architecture of the model can be changed or fine-tuned to achieve better results.
